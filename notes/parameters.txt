PARAMETERS THAT CAN BE SPECIFIED

- whether raw or computed wakeup


- sleep LoopingCall frequency
- wakeup LoopingCall frequency

- sleep energy consumption
- wakeup energy consumption (in both wakeup functions!)
- energy usage of measuring each variable

- turning radio on/off (off?)
- energy of sending a packet
    - frequency of sending packets?? still hard-coded
- size of packet (is that incorporated in bandwidth?)


- energy usage of computations (?)


in configs:
- initial energy of sensor
- bandwidth of connection
- energy usages of variables
- output min/max of variables
- num datapoints to be cached in sensor
