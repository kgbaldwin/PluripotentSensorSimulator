PARAMETERS THAT CAN BE SPECIFIED

[command line]
- whether raw or computed wakeup

in configs:
- initial energy of sensor
- bandwidth of connection
- energy usages of variables
- output min/max of variables
- num datapoints to be cached in sensor

- sleep energy consumption
- wakeup energy consumption
- energy usage of measuring each variable

- turning radio on/off (off?)
- energy of sending a packet
    - frequency of sending packets?? still hard-coded ######
- size of packet (is that incorporated in bandwidth?)
